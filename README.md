**Hi!**
============
============
The script that runs the analysis is "run_analysis.R"
===
The order of the questions isn't really respected, for example I first set the correct col names then I merge the test and train data.
most of the commands in the script are commented.
===
the finalDataSet.txt is the data set that results from answering the last question
===
Enjoy!
